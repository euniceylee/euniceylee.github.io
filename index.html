              <p class="pub">Quartz</p>
              <p>Quartz Bot Studio experiments with applications of bots, AI, and related technologies for journalism on new platforms. The studio builds on work from the Quartz app, which presents news in a conversational interface, as though the user is texting with Quartz. During my time I worked on conversational design, fixed bugs, wrote production code and wrote Obsessions content for the <a href="http://qz.com/m target="_blank">Quartz for Messenger</a> bot, which made its debut at SXSW Interactive 2018. The bot has more than 8,000 active users. Check it out: http://qz.com/m</p>

              <p class="pub">side project</p>
              <p>A Facebook messenger bot that helps college students find the right mental health specialist under their insurance plan and near their location. We thought this served a need because, from our experiences, college campuses offer a limited amount of free counseling sessions. Students battling mental health don't often find the long-term help they need, and finding a quality specialist can be really scary/difficult. So, my buddy Matt and I built a prototype version of this bot at a hackathon hosted by ProPublica, Better Doctor and Yelp. Our project won the $1,000 Yelp cash prize for best use of their API and the best use of the Better Doctor API award. You can <a href="https://medium.com/@euniceylee/how-we-built-carebot-ce162223596c">read more</a> about how we designed and developed it. <a href="https://github.com/mazhang2718/care-bot">Code here</a> </p>
