          <p class="description">Hi there! I'm a design-minded storyteller and hobbyist developer at Northwestern University. I like to create work that explores the intersections of art, design, marketing and code - usually in the form of side projects. At school, I'm a student fellow at the <a href="https://www.knightlab.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Knight Lab</a> where I build community and a computer science researcher at the <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a>. Most recently, I just wrapped up my summer at Discovery Channel as a consumer insights and design research intern. Other past gigs include covering the 2016 election for <a href="http://medillonthehill.medill.northwestern.edu/author/elee/" target="_blank"> Medill News Service</a>, creating graphics for <a href="www.nbcnews.com" target="_blank">NBC News</a> and improving ProPublica's APIs. </p>

                <p class="pub">side project</p>
                <p>A Facebook messenger bot that helps college students find the right mental health specialist under their insurance plan and near their location. We thought this served a need because, from our experiences, college campuses offer a limited amount of free counseling sessions. Students battling mental health don't often find the long-term help they need, and finding a quality specialist can be really scary/difficult. So, my buddy Matt and I built a prototype version of this bot at a hackathon hosted by ProPublica, Better Doctor and Yelp. Our project won the $1,000 Yelp cash prize for best use of their API and the best use of the Better Doctor API award. You can <a href="https://medium.com/@euniceylee/how-we-built-carebot-ce162223596c">read more</a> about how we designed and developed it. <a href="https://github.com/mazhang2718/care-bot">Code here</a> </p>
